//Activity One
//Create an array that lists your favourite films, up to 5 elements.
//Add 2 more using a method.Use a loop to cycle through the array


//Activity Two
//Generate 6 random numbers between 1-50 and log them to the console.


//Activity Three
//If we can create a loop to put 0-9 on the screen, 
//how can we count from 9-0? Create a program that does this


//Activity Four
//Displays 4 films stored in an array. Use a for loop to show each film in the array.
//Use an if statement to check if the 3rd film in the array is Ghostbusters. 
//If it is, return “Yay it’s Ghostbusters”. If it isn’t return “Boo! we want Ghostbusters!



//Activity Five
//Generate a random number between 1 and 30 six times.
//For each random number generated, check if this number of divisible by 7 or not.
//Log out a message to the console if it is divisible by 7 or not.



// Activity Six
//Imagine you’re a programmer for a social media platform! 
//You have been tasked with building a prototype for a mutual followers program. 
//Create 2 arrays of followers e.g. bobsFollowers & hannahsFollowers. 
//In these arrays place 4 names as strings. Make sure there are 2 names that are in BOTH arrays.
//Using a nested loop iterate over both arrays and console.log out the 
//matching follower


//Activity Seven
//Research on do...while loop, find out about the difference between 
//for loop, while loop and do...while loop. Give an example of each. 
//What are the pros and cons?
